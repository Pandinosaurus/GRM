Summary
=======

This module provides the GRM OTB application to perform multiscale region-merging segmentation on satellite images.
Three local homogeneity criteria are available: the Baatz & Schäpe criterion, the Full Lambda Schedule criterion and
the simple Euclidean Distance criterion.

This application uses the GRM (Generic Region Merging) library which allows to add quickly a new local homogeneity criterion.
Look at the template header file: GRMSegmenterTemplate.h to see which format you must respect to add a new criterion.
